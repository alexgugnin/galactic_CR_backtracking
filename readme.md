# Investigation of the backtracking trajectories of EHECRs in the Milky way local


This repository aimed to conduct simulations of cosmic ray propagation primarily
using the CRPropa Python library. Two investigative approaches were employed:
first, observing a 20 kpc radius sphere as a detector and visualizing the
endpoints of cosmic ray trajectories (for Z = 1, 2, 6, 26);
second, analyzing the trajectories intersecting a surface with certain objects
of interest to statistically evaluate their likelihood of being the true sources
of the backtracked cosmic rays.
